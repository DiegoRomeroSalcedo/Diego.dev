Sale of the inventory and sales management system to an SME in the auto parts and motorcycle sector based in Sincelejo, Sucre. This process covered the entire software lifecycle, from planning, requirements, and the impact it would have on the business. For this project, the MVC architecture pattern, **OOP**, and **SOLID** principles were used, along with **Php** and **JavaScript** as the main programming languages. The system is modular, with the most representative modules being listings and sales generation, which allow for the creation of POS invoices. Additionally, libraries such as **Datatables**, **Chart.js**, **Dotenv**, among others, were used.
